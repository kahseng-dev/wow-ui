# World of Warcraft UIs
wow-ui is a personal repository in which I showcase and share my personally designed user interfaces made for World of Warcraft(wow) private servers that I've played on. 

As I'm not the owner of the addons used. Please download them from the respective links (Waperia or Felbite) during your installation with reference to the project's README and addon list.
